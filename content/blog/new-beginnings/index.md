```

React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source, 

front end, JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces 

or UI components. 


It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual 

developers and companies. 



React can be used as a base in the development of single-page 

or mobile applications. 



React usually requires the use of additional libraries for state 

management and routing. Redux and React Router are respective 

examples of such libraries.
